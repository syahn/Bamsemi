# Bamsemi: Find 24 hours cafe in Seoul (ver 0.0.2)

This web app is for the designers, developers, students, and all the people who need to find nearby 24-hour cafes in Seoul. There are a couple of apps providing location data to people like Google map and Naver map & Daum map (Big search engine companies in the South korea). I realized that they doesn't provide options for searching 24 hour cafes by their services. That's why I decided to make this for some people who want to find them.

## To be updated

## Reflection

It's been way more difficult than I expected so that I come to learn a lot.

1. I got used to use MV* pattern framework.
  + I became to want to use other frameworks like Angular, React.
2. Optimization should be considered before cosmetic problems.
  + It's too heavy now so that It takes a lot of time to load up the page.
3. Learning gulp and bower to make my workflow simple
  + Let's make these a way of life
4. Deploying apps with firebase
  + It's simple and fast, but hosting custom domain.
